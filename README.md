# Nand2Tetris-Solution

This repository showcases my ability to build and program a computer from scratch, with files for an assembler, virtual machine, high-level languages, and an operating system. My projects here demonstrate my knowledge of computer architecture, compilation, and programming, and all relate to the HACK computer of the Nand2Tetris project.

The following four projects are included:

- Project 6:
I wrote an assembler in Python that translates ASM code into machine language.

- Project 8:
I wrote a translator in C# that translates VM code into ASM code.

- Project 11:
I wrote a compiler in C# that compiles Jack code into VM code.

- Project 12:
I wrote the necessary Jack classes for the Jack operating system.

To test my solutions, download the tools from the GDrive link on the [Nand2Tetris website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software). You will also need Java installed on your computer, which you can download from [here](https://www.java.com/download).
